FUSE for 3DS save file
----

Inspired by [3dsfuse](https://github.com/3dshax/3ds/tree/master/3dsfuse) but rewritten with [a newer research](https://github.com/wwylele/3ds-save-tool).

TODO:
 - crypto layer and wear leveling support
 - Resign AES-CMAC header
 - File truncate support?
 - Extdata support
